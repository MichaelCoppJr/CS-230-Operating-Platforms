# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

Module Eight Journal Reflection:

**Client Summary and Software Requirements**

  The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand their existing game into a web-based, multi-platform application. The primary requirement was to design software that could support multiple users concurrently while maintaining consistency, performance, and scalability across different operating platforms. The client needed a solution that could grow with user demand and operate reliably in a distributed environment.

**Strengths in Developing the Design Documentation**

  One area I performed particularly well was clearly documenting the system architecture and platform considerations. I focused on explaining how different operating platforms and deployment environments would impact performance, scalability, and cost. I also ensured the design documentation communicated technical decisions in a way that would be understandable to both developers and non-technical stakeholders.

**Helpful Aspects of the Design Process**

  Working through the design document before coding helped clarify system requirements and constraints early in the process. Defining the architecture, components, and platform choices ahead of time reduced confusion during development and made it easier to understand how individual pieces of the system fit together. This structured approach reinforced the importance of planning before implementation.

**Areas for Improvement**

  If I could revise one part of the design documentation, I would expand on the risk analysis and mitigation strategies. While potential issues were identified, I could improve this section by providing more detailed contingency plans and alternative solutions, especially related to scalability and long-term maintenance.

**Interpreting and Implementing User Needs**

  I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on scalability, availability, and ease of access across platforms. These needs were implemented through design decisions that favored cloud-based deployment and modular architecture. Considering user needs is critical because the success of a system depends not only on technical correctness, but also on how well it meets real-world usage expectations.

**Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies**

  My approach to designing the software involved breaking down requirements into manageable components, evaluating platform constraints, and selecting architectures that supported growth and flexibility. In the future, I would continue using techniques such as requirements analysis, UML diagrams, and platform comparison to guide design decisions. These strategies help ensure that software solutions are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with both technical and business goals.
